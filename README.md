<br />


A small PocketMine-MP plugin designed to help starting developers get an idea of the frame of the plugin.
this can also be used to just start working on a plugin without needing to waste any time on the starter stuff.

A/N: If you don't like the way its set or just hate it, Then don't even bother using it. It's that simple... This was made for those who need it. :wink:

Contributions are very welcome :smile:<br />You may contribute by opening a Pull Request and if it has been proven to be correct & working, I'll surely merge it.
